General Notes:

Destructuring
https://wesbos.com/destructuring-objects/

JS expression that allows data extraction from arrays, objects, maps, and sets into their own variable. Allows for property extraction, multiple at a time.

const person = {
  first: 'Wes',
  last: 'Bos',
  country: 'Canada',
  city: 'Hamilton',
  twitter: '@wesbos'
};
const first = person.first;
const last = person.last;

vs.

const { first, last } = person;
The above code says, give me a variable called first, a variable called last, and take it from the person object. Weâ€™re taking the first property and the last property and putting them into two new variables that will be scoped to the parent block (or window!).
